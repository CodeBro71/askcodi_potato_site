        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Irish Potato Famine was a period of mass starvation and disease in Ireland from 1845 to 1852. It was caused by a potato blight that destroyed the potato crops, which were the main food source for the Irish population at the time.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>The main cause of the famine was the Phytophthora infestans, a fungus-like organism that attacked the potato crops and led to their failure. The reliance on potatoes as a staple food source, the oppressive British colonial rule, and the lack of proper food distribution also contributed to the severity of the famine.</p>
